6. "Ok Google! Light it up!"


## 1. Configuring Arduino Nano 33 IoT

The Arduino Nano 33 IoT is Arduino's smallest board to get started with Internet of Things (IoT). Using the popular Arm® Cortex®-M0 32-bit SAMD21 processor, it also features the powerful u-blox NINA-W102 Wi-Fi module and the ECC608A crypto-chip for security.
